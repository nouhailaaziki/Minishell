from what i understood quotes expansion should be indeppendant , expand of vars shuld be independant ,

i need to also create a reallocating function for export $a=$a..., th heredoc expand should also be handled

the value that should be exported should be checked and splitted only when it has space inside of it

----
function that checks if there is a space outside the quotes inside a command {"alpha"$a} ={"alpha"ls la} =>{{"alpha"ls} {la}}
---
i think i store all the args ina linked list ,
 then i filter the empty ones then i re allocate a new 2d array where i put only the valid ones,
 then i rest the main expand index to restart the check for the newly created array, something is wrong when looping , sometimes it works raely , others it returns empty string
----
single quote failure , probably in rebuild list ,things that expand and shouldnt split does , probably in store arg as well . thats what i c an remember
-------
ok , from eat i can tell the xport cases are almost all andled by default in y current setup , what i need to do right now is
make a function that checks if export is the first command with the valid instructions as show in the tdr file , and then i should just make it inject quotes if all the checks are done correctly, else it shoul just sip it and allow expand vars to work normally .
where there would be a problem is when it works but im  afraid of the case where it would try to loop to infinty because i keep rebuild ing the d array , but then again , it sgouldnt bae an issue right ? ,
because if it works  its work it should not reverse aain right ? for expand le a expand of a variable that would be filled with export , how can i chck tht it is an expanded value or an original, ill figure that later/
